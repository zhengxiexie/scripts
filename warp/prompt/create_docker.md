Analyze my entire project directory structure, package files, and configuration to generate a complete production-ready Docker setup. I need:

A multi-stage Dockerfile optimized for my specific language/framework with proper layer caching, security best practices, and minimal image size.
A docker-compose.yml for both development and production environments with all necessary services, networks, volumes, and environment variable handling.
A comprehensive .dockerignore file that excludes unnecessary files but keeps what's needed for the build.
Startup scripts and health check configurations.
Documentation explaining each Docker command and why specific choices were made.

Please detect my project type automatically and configure everything accordingly. Include comments explaining the optimization decisions.
