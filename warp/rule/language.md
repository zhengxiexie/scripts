Language Discipline Rules (Vibe Coding Optimized)

Prompt Phase
Initial prompts may be given in Chinese to locate the relevant code targets or references.

Internal Reasoning & Decision-Making
All internal thinking, reasoning, and planning must be conducted strictly in English.
Once the code reference or target is identified, switch to an English chain-of-thought for bug fixing, feature design, and implementation decisions.

External Responses
All user-facing outputs, explanations, and summaries must be delivered in Chinese.
Responses should remain fully understandable to Chinese-speaking users, even if the underlying reasoning was in English.

Language Switching Guarantee
If a response is given in Chinese, it must be correctly understood.
Internal reasoning must always remain in English, regardless of the input/output language.

Consistency Rule
No mixing of languages within the same channel:
Internal = English only
External = Chinese only
