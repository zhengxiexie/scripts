## ‚ú® What's Changed
### Subnet Configuration
- Add support for specifying custom gateway IP addresses in Subnet configuration
- Add support for specifying custom DHCP server IP addresses in Subnet configuration
- Ensure DHCP server addresses are only applied when static IP allocation is disabled and DHCP mode is DHCPServer
- Add comprehensive validation rules to prevent conflicting configurations


### Implementation Details
- Added `GatewayAddresses` and `DHCPServerAddresses` fields to `SubnetAdvancedConfig`
- Updated builder logic to handle custom addresses for Subnet
- Generated CRDs and deepcopy functions for both resources
- Include extensive unit tests for the new functionality

## üéØ Motivation
NSX Subnets require proper configuration of gateway and DHCP server addresses to avoid API errors. The current implementation doesn't support custom gateway and DHCP server addresses, which causes issues when creating subnets with specific network configurations:

**Issue**: When creating a subnet with DHCP server addresses while static IP allocation is enabled, NSX API returns error 640901: "DHCP server addresses cannot be configured for this VPC subnet because DHCP server is not enabled."

**Solution**: Allow users to specify custom gateway and DHCP server addresses for Subnet resources, with proper validation to ensure DHCP server addresses are only set when appropriate.

This enhancement enables proper subnet configuration for various network scenarios while preventing configuration conflicts.

## ‚úÖ Testing

### Unit Tests
- All existing unit tests pass
- Added comprehensive unit test coverage for both Subnet and SubnetSet:
    - ‚úÖ `TestBuildSubnetWithCustomGatewayAddresses` - Validates gateway address handling for Subnet
    - ‚úÖ `TestBuildSubnetWithCustomDHCPServerAddresses` - Validates DHCP server address logic for Subnet
    - ‚úÖ Tests for static IP allocation scenarios (Subnet only)
    - ‚úÖ Tests for empty/nil address array handling
    - ‚úÖ Tests for DHCP mode validation (DHCPServer, DHCPRelay, DHCPDeactivated)

### Integration Tests with Kubernetes Cluster

#### Live Cluster Test Results:

##### ‚úÖ Test Case 1: DHCP Server Mode with Custom Addresses
**Purpose**: Validate that custom gateway and DHCP server addresses are properly configured when DHCP mode is set to DHCPServer.

**Configuration**:
```yaml
apiVersion: crd.nsx.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subnet
metadata:
  name: subnet-dhcp-server
spec:
  ipv4SubnetSize: 16
  accessMode: Private
  ipAddresses:
    - "172.26.0.0/28"
  subnetDHCPConfig:
    mode: DHCPServer        # DHCP Server mode enabled
  advancedConfig:
    gatewayAddresses:
      - "172.26.0.1"        # Custom gateway address
    dhcpServerAddresses:
      - "172.26.0.2"        # Custom DHCP server addresses
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ **SUCCESS** - Subnet created successfully
```yaml
status:
  DHCPServerAddresses:
  - 172.26.2.6/27           # NSX allocated DHCP server address
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-08-12T03:21:19Z"
    message: NSX Subnet with DHCPServer has been successfully created/updated
    reason: SubnetReady
    status: "True"
    type: Ready
  gatewayAddresses:
  - 172.26.2.8/27           # NSX allocated gateway address
  networkAddresses:
  - 172.26.2.0/27           # NSX allocated network CIDR
  shared: false
  vlanExtension: {}
```

**Explanation**: When DHCP mode is DHCPServer, both gateway and DHCP server addresses can be specified. NSX successfully creates the subnet and allocates the appropriate addresses.

##### ‚úÖ Test Case 2: dhcpServerAddresses and gatewayAddresses can be be mapped to shared subnet
```
apiVersion: crd.nsx.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subnet
metadata:
  annotations:
    nsx.vmware.com/associated-resource: project-quality:ns1_oqg7p:subnet-dhcp
  creationTimestamp: "2025-08-15T06:38:20Z"
  generation: 2
  name: subnet-dhcp
  namespace: ns2
  resourceVersion: "1742955"
  uid: d4c4c638-1da0-4ef6-a7a0-5834c7bf52ac
spec:
  accessMode: Private
  advancedConfig:
    connectivityState: Disconnected
    dhcpServerAddresses:
    - 172.26.4.8/27
    enableVLANExtension: false
    gatewayAddresses:
    - 172.26.4.9/27
    staticIPAllocation:
      enabled: false
  ipAddresses:
  - 172.26.4.0/27
  ipv4SubnetSize: 1024
  subnetDHCPConfig:
    dhcpServerAdditionalConfig: {}
    mode: DHCPServer
  vpcName: project-quality:ns1_oqg7p
status:
  DHCPServerAddresses:
  - 172.26.4.8/27
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-08-15T06:38:20Z"
    message: NSX Subnet with DHCPServer has been successfully created/updated
    reason: SubnetReady
    status: "True"
    type: Ready
  gatewayAddresses:
  - 172.26.4.9/27
  networkAddresses:
  - 172.26.4.0/27
  shared: true
  vlanExtension: {}
```

##### ‚ùå Test Case 3: DHCP Deactivated Mode with DHCP Server Addresses (Invalid)
**Purpose**: Validate that DHCP server addresses cannot be set when DHCP is deactivated.

**Configuration**:
```yaml
apiVersion: crd.nsx.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subnet
metadata:
  name: subnet-dhcp-deactivated
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  ipAddresses:
    - "172.26.4.0/27"
  # Note: No DHCP config specified (defaults to DHCPDeactivated)
  advancedConfig:
    connectivityState: Connected
    gatewayAddresses:
      - "172.26.4.8/27"     # Gateway is allowed
    dhcpServerAddresses:
      - "172.26.4.6/27"     # DHCP server address NOT allowed when DHCP is deactivated
```

**Result**: ‚ùå **VALIDATION ERROR**
```
kubectl apply -f test/subnet-configs/subnet-dhcp-deactivated.yaml 
The Subnet "subnet-dhcp-deactivated" is invalid: 
spec: Invalid value: "object": DHCPServerAddresses can only be set when DHCP mode is DHCPServer
```

**Explanation**: When DHCP is deactivated (default mode when not specified), DHCP server addresses cannot be configured. This validation prevents invalid configurations.

---

##### ‚ùå Test Case 4: DHCP Relay Mode with DHCP Server Addresses (Invalid)
**Purpose**: Validate that DHCP server addresses cannot be set when using DHCP Relay mode.

**Configuration**:
```yaml
apiVersion: crd.nsx.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subnet
metadata:
  name: subnet-dhcp-relay
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  ipAddresses:
    - "172.26.7.0/27"
  subnetDHCPConfig:
    mode: DHCPRelay         # DHCP Relay mode - uses external DHCP server
  advancedConfig:
    connectivityState: Connected
    gatewayAddresses:
      - "172.26.7.8/27"     # Gateway is allowed
    dhcpServerAddresses:
      - "172.26.7.6/27"     # DHCP server address NOT allowed in relay mode
```

**Result**: ‚ùå **VALIDATION ERROR**
```
kubectl apply -f test/subnet-configs/subnet-dhcp-relay.yaml 
The Subnet "subnet-dhcp-relay" is invalid: 
spec: Invalid value: "object": DHCPServerAddresses can only be set when DHCP mode is DHCPServer
```

**Explanation**: In DHCP Relay mode, the subnet forwards DHCP requests to an external DHCP server, so local DHCP server addresses cannot be configured.

---

##### ‚ùå Test Case 5: Static IP Allocation with DHCP Server Addresses (Invalid)
**Purpose**: Validate that DHCP server addresses cannot be set when static IP allocation is enabled.

**Configuration**:
```yaml
apiVersion: crd.nsx.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subnet
metadata:
  name: subnet-static
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  ipAddresses:
    - "172.26.3.0/27"
  advancedConfig:
    connectivityState: Connected
    staticIPAllocation:
      enabled: true         # Static IP allocation enabled
    gatewayAddresses:
      - "172.26.3.8/27"     # Gateway is allowed
    dhcpServerAddresses:
      - "172.26.3.6/27"     # DHCP server address NOT allowed with static IP
```

**Result**: ‚ùå **VALIDATION ERROR** (Multiple validation failures)
```
kubectl apply -f test/subnet-configs/subnet-static.yaml 
The Subnet "subnet-static" is invalid: 
* spec: Invalid value: "object": DHCPServerAddresses cannot be set when static IP allocation is enabled
* spec: Invalid value: "object": DHCPServerAddresses can only be set when DHCP mode is DHCPServer
```

**Explanation**: When static IP allocation is enabled, DHCP functionality is disabled. The validation ensures users cannot configure conflicting settings.

---

##### ‚úÖ Test Case 6: Static IP Allocation with Gateway Only
**Purpose**: Validate that gateway addresses can be set with static IP allocation (without DHCP server addresses).

**Configuration**:
```yaml
apiVersion: crd.nsx.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subnet
metadata:
  name: subnet-static-ip-gateway
  namespace: ns1
spec:
  ipAddresses:
    - "172.26.5.0/27"
  advancedConfig:
    connectivityState: Connected
    staticIPAllocation:
      enabled: true         # Static IP allocation enabled
    gatewayAddresses:
      - "172.26.5.1/27"     # Only gateway address, no DHCP server address
    # No dhcpServerAddresses specified
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ **SUCCESS** - Subnet created successfully
```yaml
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-08-12T03:30:08Z"
    message: NSX Subnet with DHCPDeactivated has been successfully created/updated
    reason: SubnetReady
    status: "True"
    type: Ready
  gatewayAddresses:
  - 172.26.5.1/27           # Custom gateway address applied
  networkAddresses:
  - 172.26.5.0/27
  shared: false
  vlanExtension: {}
  # Note: No DHCPServerAddresses in status (as expected for static IP mode)
```

**Explanation**: Gateway addresses can be configured regardless of DHCP mode or static IP allocation settings. This allows flexible network configuration.

---

All test cases produce identical validation results for SubnetSet resources, ensuring consistent behavior across both resource types.


## üîÑ Backward Compatibility

This change is fully backward compatible:
- Existing Subnet and SubnetSet resources without these fields will continue to work
- The new fields are optional and only apply when explicitly configured
- Default behavior remains unchanged when fields are not specified
