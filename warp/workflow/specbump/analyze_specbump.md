## Analyze Specbump Failure Workflow (Enhanced)

### 1. Artifact and Log Download

**Input:**
- Jenkins job URL: `https://jenkins-vcfwcp.devops.broadcom.net/job/ncp-spec-bump/{{number}}`

**Steps:**

- Download the pipeline artifacts and logs from the specified Jenkins job URL, focusing on failure-related files.
- Specifically, look for support bundles:
    - `*wcp-support-bundle.tar`
    - `*vc-support.tgz`

***

### 2. Extract and Inspect Logs

**Steps:**

- Extract the downloaded tarball and tgz files to a local workspace.
- Locate the important log files inside the extracted support bundles, focusing on:
    - `nsx-operator` component logs
    - WCP service logs, particularly at:
        - `/var/log/vmware/wcp/stdstream.log.stdout`
        - `/var/log/vmware/wcp/stdstream.log.stderr`

***

### 3. Log Analysis

**Approach:**

- Use modern CLI tools (e.g., `rg`, `bat`, `fd`) to:
    - Search logs for errors, warnings, and stack traces.
    - Filter relevant timestamps around the pipeline failure.
- Correlate findings with pipeline failure messages or error codes reported on Jenkins.
- Identify root cause suspects such as:
    - Configuration errors
    - Operator crashes
    - Service restarts or failures

***

### 4. Output and Recommendations

**Deliverables:**

- Summarize the reasons for the pipeline failure with evidence from logs.
- Highlight relevant error messages and suspicious patterns.
- Provide actionable recommendations or next steps for debugging/fixing.

***

### 5. Best Practices & Automation Tips

- Automate artifact download and extraction via scripts where possible.
- Maintain a workspace structure for storing analyzed logs.
- Reuse modern CLI tools for efficient log querying and viewing.
- Document common failure patterns and share in the team knowledge base.
