- **PR Number and Title:** Pull Request {{PR}} (title fetched from GitHub)
- **Author:** (Author of the PR)
- **Change Highlights:**  
  This pull request introduces the following modifications (example):
    - Fixes a critical memory leak in the NSX Operator controller by enhancing resource cleanup.
    - Modifies key files related to controller memory management and adds or updates unit tests.

***

### Motivation / Why
- The changes address an important issue impacting production stability, specifically fixing out-of-memory crashes caused by improper resource handling.
- These fixes improve the robustness and performance of the operator, preventing service disruptions.

***

### Implementation Details / How
- The implementation achieves its goals by adding explicit resource cleanup logic in the reconciliation loop of the controller.
- Key design choices include:
    - Focused updates on the controller memory logic.
    - Addition and refinement of tests in `_test.go` files for better coverage and validation.
    - Use of modern, clear patterns for resource management to improve maintainability.

***

### Suggestions for Improvement
- At specific lines in the changed files, consider these concrete suggestions to improve code quality and clarity:
    - *At `pkg/controller/memory.go` line 50:* Add more comprehensive unit tests to cover edge cases and concurrency scenarios (improves test robustness).
    - *At `pkg/controller/memory.go` line 75:* Refactor the function for improved readability and modularityâ€”breaking down complex blocks into smaller helper functions can ease maintenance.
